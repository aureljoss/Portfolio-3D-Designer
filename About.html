            <div id="description">
              <p>
                Over the past ten years, I've built products for companies,
                businesses and government entities around the globe with a focus
                on
                <span class="bold"
                  >design, usability, accessibility and inclusivity.</span
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                While the products I design have been in the built environment,
                the skills I have learned as an architect and designer are all
                applicable to the <span class="bold">digital world</span>. From
                working with multi-disciplinary teams, to iterating through
                design concepts and working with stakeholders, I am committed to
                meeting client expectations while creating great
                <span class="bold">user experiences</span>.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I focus on my career transition to
                <span class="bold">3D experience designer</span>, I have have
                also been immersed in the world of computer programming for more
                than a year with an emphasis on implementing modern web best
                practices. I am currently learning
                <span class="bold">3D web-based interactive rendering </span>
                with Three.js and WebGL.
              </p>
              <!--<p> My interest in web development started back in 2015 when I was editing custom Squarespace themes for my architectural portfolio</p>
                                <p> Fast-forward to fall 2021, I decided to start the front end developer training on Codecademy and pursue a carreer change in front end developement.</p> -->
              <h6 id="collapsible">Tell me more!</h6>
              <div id="hidden-text">
                <p>
                  Well since you've asked, I was born and raised in the south of
                  <span class="bold">France </span><span>&#129472;</span> (yes,
                  I love cheese!). During my bachelors at the University of
                  Clermont-Ferrand, I had the opportunity to study abroad in the
                  US. One thing led to another, and here I am, ten years later,
                  living and working in
                  <span class="bold">Washington D.C.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                  The stability provided from obtaining my green card a few
                  years ago, allowed me to step back and reassess my<span
                    class="bold"
                  >
                    passions and career goals</span
                  >. I came to realize that I found more value focussing my
                  creative problem solving abilities on the rapidly evolving
                  digital environment like the world of 3D experience design
                  rather than building design. What used to be an itch to switch
                  to a career in tech became a need.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In my downtime, you can find me
                  <span class="bold"
                    >eating tacos, biking, or at the dog park</span
                  >. I am also a bad but enthusiastic pickleball player who
                  occasionally shows up at the D.C. queer pickleball league.
