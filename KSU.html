          <h6>The problem</h6>
          <p>
            The Kennesaw State University campus in Marietta is experiencing rapid growth in research coupled with a <span class="bold">15 percent increase in enrollment over the past two years. </span>
            Research and teaching labs have become over utilized and are not able to support research innovation and changes in the teaching environment.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Marietta campus, previously Southern Polytechnic State University,
            does not reflect the culture, identity and architectural language of KSU's main campus and <span class="bold">lacks a defined campus entry.</span></p>
          </p>
          <h6>Research Objectives</h6>
          <p>The following objectives were established prior to the start of the research process:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identifying the patterns behind the campus design</li>
              <li>Understanding the user’s goals and priorities behind the building program</li>
              <li>Learning from state-of-the-art facilities at other universities.</li>
            </ul>
          <h6>Research</h6>
          <p>The first step is to understand site attributes and constraints. Located at the edge of the campus quad, the parcel is highly visible from the main vehicular campus entry. 
            A number of existing utilities are running through the site, including a main power line with a 100ft setback, and main water and electric lines. 
            Existing building service entries and setbacks were also surveyed in order to inform the future building footprint.</p>
            <img src="images/KSU/Site Utilities.png" class="secondary-images" alt="site utilities">
          <p>At a macro level, the campus is made up of two to four stories buildings, all oriented towards the campus quad. 
            The majority of the buildings were built during the 60s and have a mid-century modern style characterized by clean lines, expansive glass facades, steel structures and concrete sunshades.</p>
            <img src="images/KSU/Site-section.png" class="secondary-images" alt="section through campus">
          <p>With an emphasis on walkability and connectivity, the campus architecture prioritizes pedestrian circulation. 
              Buildings are arranged in a way that encourages foot traffic, with pathways, plaza, and open spaces strategically positioned to facilitate movement and interaction.</p>
          <img src="images/KSU/Site Plan - crop.jpg" class="secondary-images" alt="Site plan showing pedestrian movement on the KSU marietta campus">
          <h6>Competitive Analysis</h6>
          <p>Looking at the program set by the client, it becomes clear that the goal is to provide a conducive environment for learning, research, and collaboration in engineering, technology, and applied sciences. </p>
          <p>Below is a benchmarking analysis of the proposed building program compared to similar STEM buildings at other universities (names and locations are left out for privacy purposes)</p>
          <img src="images/KSU/Benchmarking.png" class="secondary-images">
          <p>While the building square footage is set to be below the average total area of similar facilities, the area set towards research spaces is well above what is seen across the industry. 
            This observation helped facilitate conversations with the client about program needs given that the cost per square footage of research space is among the highest by space type.</p>
          <p>Prior to our programming workshops with user groups, the building was set to be 100,000 GSF. After a few program iterations and efforts to understand gaps in space utilization during pre-design, the building program came down to roughly 70,000 GSF. 
            This was a crucial step in getting the building on budget prior to going into the design phase.</p>
          <h6 class="section-portfolio">Key Findings</h6>
          <p>During the pre-design process, a series of four workshops were conducted to understand the vision for this project. The following key findings were identified:</p>
          <ul style="line-height: 1.6rem;">
            <li>The design needs to <span class='bold'>embrace the campus fabric </span>through a rich composition of scale, materiality and architectural language.</li>
            <li>The building space planning needs to promote collaboration between different STEM disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary research and <span class="bold">innovation.</span>
            </li>
            <li>The new building needs to help <span class="bold">recruit</span> top-tier faculty members and students, as well as retain existing talent by providing them with a state-of-the-art facility. </li>
            <li>The design solution needs to achieve a balance between form and function, creating spaces that are visually appealing while also being functional, practical and <span class='bold'>visible.</span></li>

        <h6>Building Map</h6>
        <p>Prior to considering the exterior massing or design of the building, the special organization of the building’s interior spaces and its relationship with the surrounding environment were studied. 
          This process involves considering various factors such as desired adjacencies, functionality, safety, building codes, accessibility and efficiency. 
          Spaces are arranged in a logical manner to facilitate movement and activities within the building. 
          This includes considering the flow of people, sight lines, and relationships between different areas.</p>
          <p>To understand desired adjacencies, a "perfect diagram" exercise is conducted during user group interviews. 
            Direct, indirect or visual adjacencies are identified in order to inform the buildings spatial organization.</p>
        <img src="images/KSU/Perfect Diagram 2.png" class="secondary-images" alt="site map">
        <h6>Lo-Fi Building Planning</h6>
        <p>Using the building map and our findings from the site analysis, a total of sixteen planning options were explored. 
          The final three were presented to the user groups, and one was picked for its best response to site and planning. 
          This is a crucial step in the architectural design process and lays the foundation for the development of architectural drawings and construction documents.
          </p>
        <img src="images/KSU/Low Fi- Planning opt 1.png" class="secondary-images" alt="building axon">
        <h6>Lo-Fi Building Massing and Design</h6>
        <p>Concurrently to creating the initial building planning, the overall building massing is being explored. The site conditions, surroundings, and context of the building inform decisions about orientation, views, natural light, opacity, transparency and environmental impact. 
          This step requires onboarding and collaboration with engineers to create a successful building design. </p>

        </div>
        <h6>Materials exploration</h6>
        <p>While the massing is not finalized at this stage, the materiality of the building and its relationship to existing buildings on campus are being researched.  Materiality plays a significant role in shaping the sensory experience and visual identity of a building. 
          The campus has a strong mid-century language with the use of brick, glass and concrete rain screens. It only seemed appropriate to celebrate this heritage and use similar materials in different textures, surface treatments and locations to contribute to the identity and context of the campus.

        <p>To showcase the design to the client and stakeholders, fully immersive VR scenes are created using Sketchup, Lumion and imported into Yulio. By experiencing the design in VR, the client is able to visualize the team’s vision and provide feedback in a more intuitive and immersive manner. 
          This leads to more informed decision-making and greater client satisfaction.</p>
