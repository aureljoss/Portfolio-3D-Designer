          <h6>The problem</h6>
          <p>
            The Kennesaw State University campus in Marietta is experiencing rapid growth in research coupled with a <span class="bold">15 percent increase in enrollment over the past two years. </span>
            Research and teaching labs have become over utilized and are not able to support research innovation and changes in the teaching environment.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Marietta campus, previously Southern Polytechnic State University,
            does not reflect the culture, identity and architectural language of KSU's main campus and <span class="bold">lacks a defined campus entry.</span></p>
          </p>
          <h6>Research Objectives</h6>
          <p>The following objectives were established prior to the start of the research process:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identifying the patterns behind the campus design</li>
              <li>Understanding the user’s goals and priorities behind the building program</li>
              <li>Learning from state-of-the-art facilities at other universities.</li>
            </ul>
          <h6>Research</h6>
          <p>The first step is to understand site attributes and constraints. Located at the edge of the campus quad, the parcel is highly visible from the main vehicular campus entry. 
            A number of existing utilities are running through the site, including a main power line with a 100ft setback, and main water and electric lines. 
            Existing building service entries and setbacks were also surveyed in order to inform the future building footprint.</p>
            <img src="images/KSU/Site Utilities.png" class="secondary-images" alt="site utilities">
          <p>At a macro level, the campus is made up of two to four stories buildings, all oriented towards the campus quad. 
            The majority of the buildings were built during the 60s and have a mid-century modern style characterized by clean lines, expansive glass facades, steel structures and concrete sunshades.</p>
            <img src="images/KSU/Site-section.png" class="secondary-images" alt="section through campus">
          <p>With an emphasis on walkability and connectivity, the campus architecture prioritizes pedestrian circulation. 
              Buildings are arranged in a way that encourages foot traffic, with pathways, plaza, and open spaces strategically positioned to facilitate movement and interaction.</p>
          <img src="images/KSU/Site Plan - crop.jpg" class="secondary-images" alt="Site plan showing pedestrian movement on the KSU marietta campus">
          <h6>Competitive Analysis</h6>
          <p>Looking at the program set by the client, it becomes clear that the goal is to provide a conducive environment for learning, research, and collaboration in engineering, technology, and applied sciences. </p>
          <p>Below is a benchmarking analysis of the proposed building program compared to similar STEM buildings at other universities (names and locations are left out for privacy purposes)</p>
          <img src="images/KSU/Benchmarking.png" class="secondary-images">
          <p>While the building square footage is set to be below the average total area of similar facilities, the area set towards research spaces is well above what is seen across the industry. 
            This observation helped facilitate conversations with the client about program needs given that the cost per square footage of research space is among the highest by space type.</p>
          <p>Prior to our programming workshops with user groups, the building was set to be 100,000 GSF. After a few program iterations and efforts to understand gaps in space utilization during pre-design, the building program came down to roughly 70,000 GSF. 
            This was a crucial step in getting the building on budget prior to going into the design phase.</p>
          <h6>Key Findings</h6>
          <p>During the pre-design process, a series of four workshops were conducted to understand the vision for this project. The following key findings were identified:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The design needs to <span class=”bold”>embrace the campus fabric </span>through a rich composition of scale, materiality and architectural language.</li>
            <li>The building space planning needs to promote collaboration between different STEM disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary research and <span class="bold">innovation.</span>
            </li>
            <li>The new building needs to help <span class="bold">recruit</span> top-tier faculty members and students, as well as retain existing talent by providing them with a state-of-the-art facility. </li>
            <li>The design solution needs to achieve a balance between form and function, creating spaces that are visually appealing while also being functional, practical and <span class=”bold”>visible.</span></li>
          </ul>

          <h6>Project goals</h6>
          <p>After extensive user group workshops, internal brainstorming session and banchmarking, I created iterative concepts that served as the foundation for the building design. 
            I used this birdseye view to establish site hierarchy and taxonomy, and to determine the number of unique page templates that would need to be designed and  built. 
            This allowed for modularity and structural flexibility from wireframes to launch.</p>
